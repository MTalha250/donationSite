            Your fundraiser story connects you with potential donors. Provide
            the details about the medical challenge (where comfortable) and what
            you or your loved one need. Detailing your need resonates more with
            donors, and we recommend you include estimated costs or details of
            what you’re raising money for.

            Before you share your fundraiser broadly with your social media
            networks, consider first asking a few of your closest friends or
            family members to help you get started by making a donation and
            adding words of encouragement. You can even add them as a team
            member to help you manage the fundraiser.

            Most people are more likely to donate to a fundraiser that has
            regular updates. Share your progress, thank your supporters, and
            keep everyone informed throughout your fundraising journey.
